# Twitter-Data-Clustering
Using Tweepy to crawling twitter data. Clustering it using K-Means

We will first take tweets data via twitter API using the script that I got from this repository: 
  https://github.com/agalea91/twitter_search
  
The file obtained will be in the json format. (The json file that I got on the crawler this time happens to be more than 25 mb so it's not available for uploading on git)

After that the preprocessing data is carried out before classifying using the k-means model.
