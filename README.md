# Twitter-Data-Clustering
Using Tweepy to crawling twitter data. Clustering it using K-Means

We will first take tweets data via twitter API using the script that I got from this repository: 
  https://github.com/agalea91/twitter_search
  

  
The file obtained will be in the json format. 

After that the preprocessing data is carried out before classifying using the k-means model.
